        "\n",
        "ANS 02: Averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits (such as using k-fold cross-validation) doesn't necessarily provide a more accurate estimate of test accuracy. Instead, it gives you a more reliable estimate of how well your model is likely to perform on unseen data, which is what test accuracy is intended to represent.\n",

        "ANS 03: The number of iterations can affect the estimate's stability, but more iterations don't necessarily guarantee a better estimate. It's crucial to strike a balance between training long enough to converge but not overfit the model.\n",

        "ANS 04 : Increasing iterations can help to some extent, but it can't fully compensate for a very small training or validation dataset. A small dataset may still result in overfitting or unreliable performance estimates, even with more iterations."
